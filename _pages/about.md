This is Liu's Homepage and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). If you are interested in my projects, please find them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/L53317). You can find the details about my work in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=btqfRYQAAAAJ). I will also update my notes about the most latest discoveries in my [Blog](https://l53317.github.io/year-archive/).

A brief introduction about Liu
======
I am a PhD student at the University of Groningen(RUG), the Netherlands. My research interests include Robotics, AI technologies, Applied Physics, Optimization and Control.

Education
======

University of Groningen
------
**PhD student, 2022.05  -  current**

1. Robot localization and multi-sensor fusion
2. Learning-based control and theories
3. Multi-robot collaboration

Getting started
======
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
